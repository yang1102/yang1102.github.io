My name is Shuoyi. I am from Beijing, China, and I came to US in 2013. I went to school at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), where I completed my Bachelor of Science in CS and Mathematics. After I graduated, I started working at [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/), a financial data and software company based in the New York area. I spent around two years there as a Front-End engineer. I joined [Linkedin Testing and Experiment Platform Team](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/topic/xlnt) on December 2018 as a Full-stack engineer, and I moved to Silicon Valley. My journey is still going on, and I hope to share it with more people.
